extension) on your SD memory. 

It may happen that the file is not properly loaded,
and so you have to try again.

To manage applications already loaded in your TI-92,
you can use the VLINK menu.

You can find many applications on
http://www.ticalc.org/ and on the official TI ftp
site ftp://ftp.ti.com/pub/graph-ti/calc-apps/92/


5. LOADING KEY MAPPING FILES
------------

If you want to modify the default keyboard mapping
between WIZ Keys and TI-92 keys you can write your
own mapping file and put them in kbd folder.

6. COMPILATION
 ------------

It has been developped under Linux FC9 using gcc
with WIZ SDK.  All tests have been done using a
GP2X-Wiz with FW 1.1.0.  To rebuild the homebrew run
the Makefile in the src archive.
